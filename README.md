# CS321-Project2

## Abstract
In this project, there are three parts/increments.

In the first increment, we need to implement our own stack file which would be used later in the following increments.

In the second increment, we start from infix expressions and convert them to postfix ones. This is further divided into two parts: first, implementing and testing the algorithm. second, combining the algorithm with the file read and file write functions.

The third increment is very similar to the second one besides we try to convert from postfix to assembly this time. We also implement and test the algorithm in the first part, but for the second part, we conbime it with the code we had in the second increment and build one file that would convert from infixes to assembly directly.

## Results
Here's the results for the test infix inputs:
data3-1.txt

data3-2-1.txt

infixes.txt (our own test file)

## Contribution
### Diane
Kayla and I implemented and tested increment 1 and the algorithm part of increment 2 through pair-coding.
And then I tested Kayla's read method in increment 2 and implemented and tested the write method.
I also implemented and tested the algorithm part in increment 3.

## Team Experience Reflection
### Diane
The Overall experience is good to me. We coorpertaed and communited effectively. We started early and had great achievements by finishing the project successfully and did the extensions 1 and 2. Pair coding is also fun and effective. However, with the fall break and packed schedule for both people, it's hard to meet and do work during that time, which added pressure to us when we came back after break and there're only two days left for us to work.

## Acknowledgement and References
We searched for Git commands and file read and write on Google/StackOverFlow.
